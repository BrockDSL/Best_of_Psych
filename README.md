## Workshop Sessions


### Session 1: Introduction to Python

**To be announced (online)**  

This session will provide you with the very basics of how to read and write Python code. We'll be using the Google Collab environment to learn so no extra software installation will be required. By the end of the sessions you'll be comfortable with the basics of Python which includes: variables, conditionals, loops, and writing function.

### Session 2: Python and Data Science in Psychology



Part 2 will build on what was started in part 1. This time we'll expand our understanding of how Python works by introducing the Pandas Library, and will focus on how one can peform some analysis on our data using Python. This will include some fairly complex statistical analysis and also graphing some visualizations using the MatPlotLib and Seaborn Libraries.

### Session 3: Python and Website Building



Part 3 will focus on building a website that recieves input from users and gives them output using PythonAnywhere. We will create an online MBTI quiz that tells users which of the 16 personalities they are. We will then learn how to extract user data from this website into an organized data table in Python (web scraping)

### Session 4: Using Python to create Psychology experiments


In the fourth and final session we will explore how to use Python's Psychopy library to create a psychology experiment
